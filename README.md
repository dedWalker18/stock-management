# Requirements

Included in the folder is **-requirements.txt** file which you can use to install all the packages necessary to run this website. You can install them by running the following command.

            pip install -r requirements.txt

------------

# How to use
  - Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you have stored this project/repository.
  
  - First, you need to install the dependencies which you might have done above. This would install all the required dependencies onto your machine/environment.

 - From there, simply run the command ```python3 main.py``` (recommended) or ```python main.py```
    - If you are running the server from a web service like Replit, you will have to specify the host in the app.run() 
    command. In the main file, simply replace ```app.run()``` with ```app.run(host='0.0.0.0')``` 
    
  - Then, assuming the default port 8100, simply head to any of the following URLs 

        http://127.0.0.1:8100/

        http://localhost:8100/
         
        http://0.0.0.0:8100/
        
    A URL will also be displayed on the terminal, which can be used to visit the web application's site.

# Health Trackers
- In this project, I have made a basic Task Manager styleapplication which can be used to store numerical and some multiple choice values. 
- Upon logging, we can use different kinds of tracker, and log values for that particular event in that tracker.
- Each user gets the CRUD functionality for their events/logs where CRUD stands for -
      - CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- I have used the following major technologies:
      
      - Python
      - Flask
      - Flask-SQLAlchemy
      - matplotlib's pyplot
      - HTML/CSS/JS/Jinja2/Bootstrap
      - SQLite
